# MyAdhocScripts

This repository is a storage for my day-to-day scripts which can be easily accessed and used. The scripts are designed to work on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

- `LinuxScripts`: This directory contains scripts that are specifically designed to work on Linux systems.
- `WindowsScripts`: This directory contains scripts that are specifically designed to work on Windows systems.

## Usage

To use any script, navigate to the appropriate directory (based on your operating system), and run the script following the instructions provided in the script's comments.
